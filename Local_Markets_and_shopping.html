					<h1>Ambalangoda Mask Museum</h1>
					<p><font>The tradition of Sri Lankan Masks has been in existence since ancient times. Mask carving is a local custom in the southern coastal region of Sri Lanka, particularly in Ambalangoda, known for its traditional masks carvings and masks dancing. The renowned institution 'Ariyapala Traditional Masks' has a history dating back many centuries and has reached perfection in the hands of the Wijesooriya family in Ambalangoda. The Ariyapala Tradition has been passed down through seven generations of traditional masks carving and Low country dancing within the family. The cultural legacy of this family has become an integral part of Ambalangoda's history. "Ariyapala Wijesooriya Gurunnanse" is considered one of the greatest master craftsmen in Sri Lanka, who passed on his extensive knowledge of traditional masks carving and dancing to Mahindapala Wijesooriya, an acclaimed master carver who has received national and international awards.</font></p>
